Name: Aloe

Binomial name: Aloe Vera

Age: freshly rooted pup

Distribution: 
Aloe vera is considered to be native only to the south-east[31] Arabian Peninsula in the Hajar Mountains in north-eastern Oman and eastern U.A.E.[32] 
However, it has been widely cultivated around the world, 
and has become naturalized in North Africa, as well as Sudan and neighboring countries, along with the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, and Madeira Islands.[16] 
It has also naturalized in the Algarve region of Portugal,[33][34] and in wild areas across Spain, especially in the region of Murcia.[35]
The species was introduced to China and various parts of southern Europe in the 17th century.[36] 
It is widely naturalized elsewhere, occurring in arid, temperate, and tropical regions of temperate continents.[4][32][37] The current distribution may be the result of cultivation.
Container: small 4 in pot

Care instructions:
n pots, the species requires well-drained, sandy potting soil, and bright, sunny conditions. 
Aloe plants can turn red from sunburn under too much direct sun, though gradual acclimation may help.[44] 
The use of a good-quality commercial propagation mix or packaged "cacti and succulent mix" is recommended, as they allow good drainage.[45] 
Terra cotta pots are preferable as they are porous.[45] 
Potted plants should be allowed to completely dry before rewatering.
