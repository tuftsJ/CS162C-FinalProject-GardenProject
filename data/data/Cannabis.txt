Rich loam like soil with lots of organic matter. Water every couple of days when young. Every other day when older and in a large pot. Mulch and provide worms and worm castings. 
Grows very fast. Growth is steady as long as proper conditions are met and has room for roots to continue to grow. Some plants can be expected to stretch to twice their size once flowering begins. Plan before you plant!
